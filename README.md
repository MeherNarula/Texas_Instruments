# TI WISH Project - Distraction Detection Band

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This repository documents my transformative experience with the **TI WISH (Texas Instruments Women in Science and Engineering)** program, which provided invaluable insights into product development and engineering innovation.

## ðŸš€ Personal Growth & Learning
The TI WISH program served as an exceptional platform for professional and technical growth. Through hands-on workshops, mentorship opportunities, and collaborative projects, I gained deep insights into:

- **Product Design Methodology**: Understanding user-centered design principles
- **Technical Problem-Solving**: Developing systematic approaches to complex challenges  
- **Engineering Innovation**: Learning to think creatively about technology solutions
- **Professional Development**: Building confidence and technical communication skills

## ðŸŽ¯ Project: Distraction Detection Band

### Problem Statement
Modern life presents countless distractions that impact productivity and focus. Our team identified the need for a wearable solution to detect and mitigate distraction patterns.

### Solution Approach
We developed a comprehensive distraction detection system using multiple sensor technologies:

- **Physiological Monitoring**: Heart rate variability and stress indicators
- **Environmental Sensors**: Ambient noise and light level detection
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Movement and posture tracking
- **Smart Notifications**: Personalized alerts and focus recommendations

### âš¡ Key Features
- Real-time distraction pattern recognition
- Multi-sensor data fusion for accurate detection
- User-friendly interface with actionable insights
- Customizable sensitivity settings
- Long-term trend analysis and reporting

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
